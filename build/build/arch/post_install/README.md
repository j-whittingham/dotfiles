# dotfiles

These dotfiles form part of a customized Arch Linux build which are  
particular to my needs. Most post install operations concern 
initializing application configurations files to complete the package 
installation so they are ready to run as I require.

## warning

Inspect the scripts to understand their configurations and amend 
accordingly.


## caveats

Packages no longer actively used by me will likely result in stale 
scripts which may reference inapplicable configuration settings or 
worse. 

It bears repeating -- inspect the scripts and amend accordingly.
